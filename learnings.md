## Core Rules
- Never melee hydras with bladed weapons — use clubs, magic, or wands of flame
- Don't berserk when surrounded — post-exhaustion slow = death
- Sigmund below XL:5 = run. Come back later.
- Always carry 2+ teleport scrolls after D:5
- Retreat to corridors when facing 2+ enemies — fight 1v1
- Rest after every fight before exploring further
- HP below 50% = retreat immediately, don't gamble
- Tab-fight (auto_fight) only trivial enemies — rats, bats, worms
- Read messages carefully — they tell you threat level
- Identify potions/scrolls on cleared, safe floors
- Orc packs: never fight in the open, lure to corridor
- Don't pick up every item — inventory management matters
- When "Too injured to fight recklessly!" appears, use attack(direction) instead of auto_fight
- Stairs are an escape route — remember where they are
- Check get_nearby_enemies() before making major decisions
- Update overlay frequently with natural thoughts for stream viewers
- Use get_state_text() for full situation awareness when confused
- Jellies/oozes corrode equipment — avoid melee if possible
- Centaurs and throwing enemies: close distance quickly or use cover
- Early game: prioritize survival over exploring every nook
- If rest() does nothing, there's probably an enemy you haven't seen
- Berserking costs time and leaves you exhausted — only use when necessary
- Learn to read combat messages: "closely misses" vs "hits" tells you accuracy
